I am a computational statistician, data scientist, machine learning engineer;
and an ardent [Bayesian](https://youtu.be/RMNwsdb5VU4).
I like [Julia](https://julialang.org),
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
[Nix](https://nixos.org),
[Neovim](https://neovim.io),
and [htmx](https://htmx.org).
I love math, computer science, coding, stats, and teaching.
I practice [Stoic Philosophy](https://stoicquotes.io) daily.
I hate bloatware and [soydevs](https://storopoli.io/2023-11-10-2023-11-13-soydev/).

I don't have social media, since I think they are overrated
and "they sell your data".
