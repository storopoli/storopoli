I am a software developer with a PhD and background in
Computational Statistics.
I am interested in performant and reliable software.
In other words, I make computers go brrr faster.

In hope of a better future,
I dedicate my free time to Bitcoin-related projects.
I contribute to the Rust Bitcoin ecosystem,
particularly [`rust-bitcoin`](https://rust-bitcoin.org)
and [Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)](https://bitcoindevkit.org).
I also work full-time at [Alpen Labs](https://alpenlabs.io)
building Bitcoin-native zero-knowledge rollups.

I am a faculty member at the Department of Computer Science at
[Universidade Nove de Julho (UNINOVE)](https://www.uninove.br).
I am also an ardent [Bayesian](https://youtu.be/RMNwsdb5VU4).

I like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
[Julia](https://julialang.org),
[Nix](https://nixos.org),
and [Vim](https://www.vim.org).

I practice [Stoic Philosophy](https://stoicquotes.io) daily.

I hate [bloatware and the soydev phenomenon](https://storopoli.io/2023-11-10-2023-11-13-soydev/).

Everything that I do is either open source or has a permissive Creative Commons license.

I don't have social media, since I think they are overrated
and "they sell your data".
